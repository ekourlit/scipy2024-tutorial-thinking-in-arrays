# SciPy 2023 tutorial: Thinking in arrays

This repository contains everything you need to follow the "[Thinking in arrays](https://cfp.scipy.org/2023/talk/XBUC8S/)" tutorial, presented at the [SciPy 2023](https://www.scipy2023.scipy.org/) conference on [Tuesday, July 11, 2023 at 8:00amâ€’12:00pm CDT](https://www.scipy2023.scipy.org/schedule) in [Classroom 103](https://meetattexas.com/floorplans#m1).

**Abstract:**

Despite its reputation for being slow, Python is the leading language of scientific computing, which generally needs large-scale (fast) computations. This is because most scientific problems can be split into "metadata munging" and "number crunching," where the latter is performed by array-oriented (vectorized) calls into precompiled routines.

This tutorial is an introduction to array-oriented programming. We'll focus on techniques that are equally useful in NumPy, Pandas, xarray, CuPy, Awkward Array, and other libraries, and we'll work in groups on three class projects: Conway's Game of Life, evaluating decision trees, and computations on ragged arrays.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have a basic familiarity with NumPy, such as the content of the "[Introduction to Numerical Computing With NumPy](https://cfp.scipy.org/2023/talk/UJBWPQ/)" tutorial.

This tutorial consists of interactive lectures and exercises, all of which are implemented in Jupyter notebooks. These Jupyter notebooks depend on the libraries listed in [environment.yml](environment.yml).

The method of running the notebooks that we support is through GitHub Codespaces, which requires a GitHub account and either 8 remaining core-hours on your free account (see [your billing](https://github.com/settings/billing)) or a [paid plan](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces).

You can also install the packages on your personal computer ([see below](#running-the-notebooks-on-your-personal-computer)), but we can't help you with installation problems if you do it this way.

### Running the notebooks in Codespaces

1. Log into your GitHub account and open this page (this repo).

2. Launch a Codespace using the green buttons shown below. It will launch in a new tab.

3. Wait a few seconds and it will automatically install the packages into your Codespace.

4. Package installation takes a few minutes, and high CPU utilization is expected. There is an option to watch the installation log (shown below).

5. On the original browser tab (this page), you may need to reload to see the running Codespace. It will have a random, but memorable, name. Open its "..." menu and "Open with..." (shown below) to select "JupyterLab," which will launch in a new tab. If JupyterLab fails to launch the first time, try it again.

6. The Codespace will shut down if it's idle, but all of your changes are saved until you _delete_ the Codespace.

### Running the notebooks on your personal computer

If you have some version of conda/mamba/Anaconda/Miniconda/Miniforge, you can install the [environment.yml](environment.yml) as a new environment, then activate that environment and run JupyterLab.

If you're new to this package manager, we recommend the mamba version of [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), which has [detailed instructions here](https://scikit-hep.org/user/installing-conda).

Once conda/mamba is installed, the command to [create an environment from a file](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) is

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpivarski-talks/2023-07-11-scipy-tutorial-advanced-numpy/main/environment.yml
conda env create -f environment.yml   # can replace "conda" with "mamba"
```

The command to [activate that environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment) is

```bash
conda activate 2023-07-11-scipy-tutorial-advanced-numpy
```

Get a copy of this repo and enter its directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jpivarski-talks/2023-07-11-scipy-tutorial-advanced-numpy.git
cd 2023-07-11-scipy-tutorial-advanced-numpy
```

Start JupyterLab with

```bash
jupyter lab
```

It should attempt to open a browser tab to the Jupyter process running on your computer, and provides some URLs in the terminal in case that doesn't work.
